## Visualization Rationale

### Visualization
We aimed to highlight how people's eating habits change throughout the day and identify which foods are most popular at specific times. A heatmap was chosen for this visualization because it allows for easy differentiation of higher meal counts with more distinct colors, effectively drawing attention to popular timeframes. Additionally, the heatmap’s structure made it easy to organize and label data by both day and time.

### Alternative Visualizations
Other visualization options were considered during the planning stage. For example, we thought about using a stacked bar chart to track meal counts over the day. However, we ultimately decided that the heatmap would better show meal counts by the hour and day for all participants. We also explored the possibility of visualizing trends specifically for coffee consumption, as it remained consistent among subjects. While some individual coffee trends were interesting, we decided that an overall tracker would offer more useful insights. Additionally, we considered visualizing the differences in eating habits between male and female subjects. However, after further analysis, we determined that focusing on the overall trends of the study would be more beneficial.

### Interaction
Our primary interactive feature involves displaying information when a user hovers over a section of the heatmap. Since the heatmap consists of clickable boxes, we implemented a tooltip feature that provides basic information when the user hovers over a box. When clicked a nutrition label is created with data on the most popular food items, snacks, and beverages. We use the information from the dataset to generate its nutrition facts by aggregating the overall calories, carbs and sugars. We considered adding additional interactivity by allowing for full column selection to generate the most popular within a certain hour but that information seemed somewhat redundant and we decided that creating a nutrition label would be more interesting.

## Overview of Development Process
To map meal counts throughout the day, we used D3 to create the heatmap visualization based on the original data. One significant challenge we encountered was the inconsistency in how foods were logged, particularly with varied spelling and formatting. For example, “Babybel Cheese” was logged in four different ways. As a result, much of our time was spent cleaning and standardizing the data to ensure that meaningful insights could be drawn.

We began by classifying the logged foods into categories like “meals,” “beverages,” or “snacks” in a new column called `food_class`. Next, we simplified food entries into broader categories (called `simplified_foods`), such as grouping all poultry-related foods (chicken, turkey, etc.) under a single label and combining entries like all types of coffee and lattes into a general “coffee” category for beverages. After organizing the data, we aggregated it by `simplified_food` to calculate the average calorie count, carbs (in grams), and sugar (in grams) for a single log entry, assuming each log represented one serving.

Once the data was cleaned, classified, and aggregated, we used it to create interactive heatmap visualizations with D3.

We first began with generating the heatmap visualization in such a way that it was readible and informative to the viewer. After that we got it to display on a website and construted the sections we needed for this project. We then created the code to generate information based on which hour and day combination was clicked. This information would then be displayed in the text section below the visualization. This feature later got upgraded into the nutrition labels that get generated below the heatmap. Once that was completed we began work on generating tooltips when the sections are hovered over. This included a highlight feature that lifts the selected square up along with a label that gives information on the day, hour, number of meals at that time, popular meal, popular snack, and popular beverage. After that we finialized the website by polishing up the titles, contribution sections, and writing the writeup in the readme of our repository.
